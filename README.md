This repository contains a utility that exposes the results of [rpki-client](https://www.rpki-client.org/)
via a HTTP API.

Usage
=====

Create a `config.yml` file and run the utility with `python -m rpkiclientweb -v -c [config_file_name]`.
Note that the default config only contains the RIPE NCC tal for ease of use during testing

Or run a docker container:
```
# edit ./config.yml and put in ./config/config.yml
docker run \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --detach \
  --name rpki-client-web \
  -v ./config:/config \
  ghcr.io/ties/rpki-client-web:dev
```

Optionally you can add `--tmpfs [configured cache_dir]` to save on IO
(recommended when running at a cloud provided with very limited IOPS).

Endpoints
=========

```
/config             - output the current config
/result             - exit code, stdout, and stderr of last rpki-client run
/metrics            - prometheus metrics
/objects/validated  - validated RPKI objects
```

Changes
=======

dev:
**Includes rpki-client 7.9 in the container**

  * aiohttp 3.8.1, prometheus-async 22.2.0
  * track rrdp serial decrease in metric
  * track repository not modified message
  * track rrdp bad message digest error (mostly caused by incorrect state on
    disk)
  * track generic TLS failures
  * improve output of rsync_timeout
  * **Behavioural change**: use rpki-client `-s` timeout set to the kill timeout.
  * Track more messages for errors during manifest parsing
  * Track assertion errors and other warnings from rpki-client
  * renamed "rrdp_tls_failure" label to "tls_failure" because it may happen for
    trust anchor certificates as well

2022-04-13 0.10.0:
**Includes rpki-client 7.8 in the container, raising the object size limit**

  * Add `rrdp_parse_aborted` and `rrdp_parse_error_file_too_big` to `rpkiclient_fetch_status_total` metric.
    Fixes #48.
  * Update interval to 1200s in the sample config
  * Add new `.metadata` keys from the json, and use buildtime in a separate metric.
  * Return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable when JSON output does not exist.
  * Include console output in web index page
  * "fallback to cache" is included in the metrics
  * "no valid mft available" warning is included in the metrics
  * "missing SIA" warning is included in the metrics.

Installation
============

For now, clone the repository and run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies.
Afterwards you can run the project if you are in the correct python environment
or by using pipenv (`pipenv run python -m rpkiclientweb -v -c ./config.yml`).

Fedora packages needed:
  * rpki-client
  * python-devel
  * git
  * python-pipenv
  * gcc

Metrics
=======

There is a prometheus endpoint available on `/metrics`. The easiest way to check
that `rpki-client` exited successfully is to monitor the exit codes. When the
process is killed due to a timeout the exit code is -9. You could create an
alert for either the existence of non-zero exit codes or for the recent
occurrence of one.

```
# HELP rpkiclient_update_total Number of rpki-client updates
# TYPE rpkiclient_update_total counter
rpkiclient_update_total{returncode="-9"} 1.0
# HELP rpkiclient_update_created Number of rpki-client updates
# TYPE rpkiclient_update_created gauge
rpkiclient_update_created{returncode="-9"} 1.5911933945483255e+09
```

#### Important metrics
  * `rpkiclient_removed_unreferenced`: The number of repositories that are no
    longer referenced from a trust anchor.
  * `rpkiclient_warnings{hostname="<repo hostname",type="<type of error>"}`:
    Tracks specific types of error per repository when they happen. For a healthy
    repository, no warnings should exist.
  * `rpki_objects{type="<type>"}`: Object count by type, both regular ("number of ROAs") and extraordinary ("number of rejected certificates") metrics.
